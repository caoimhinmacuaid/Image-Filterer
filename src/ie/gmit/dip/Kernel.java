public class Kernel {
	/*
	   A convolution kernel is a 2D array of numbers that can be used to apply
	   a filtering effect to an image. Each of the kernels implemented below are
	   declared as "public static final double[][]":
		 
		 1) public: they can be accessed from outside their class and package.
		 2) static: there is only one instance of this array.
		 3) final: the array is a constant.
		 4) double: the array type is set to double instead of int to make computation easier.
	   
	   Because the arrays are all static, they belong to the this class Kernel and not to an 
	   instance of this class. You should therefore refer to each array using the 
	   ClassName.featureName notation, e.g. double[][] kernel = Kernel.SOBEL_HORIZONTAL; You can
	   alse refer directly to the indices as follows:
		  for (int row = 0; row < Kernel.SOBEL_HORIZONTAL.length; row++){
		      for (int col = 0; col < Kernel.SOBEL_HORIZONTAL[row].length; col++){
		         ....
			 }
		  }
		
	   There are lots of other convolution kernels for applying different effects. You should 
	   feel free to add / delete from here as you see fit. In addition, you should consider
	   converting the type Kernel from a class into an enum. An enum is more suitable, as it
	   acts as a container for a suite of constants. Have a look at the enum ConsoleColour 
	   to see how easy this is to do.
